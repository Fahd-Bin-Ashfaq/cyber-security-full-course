# Classification of IP Addresses

## 1. Public IP Address
- **Definition**: A Public IP address is an address that is assigned to your network by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and can be accessed over the Internet.
- **Example**: Think of it like your home address that people can use to send you mail.

## 2. Private IP Address
- **Definition**: A Private IP address is used within a private network (like your home or office) and is not accessible from the outside internet. It is used for communication between devices on the same local network.
- **Example**: This is like an internal address used by your family members at home, which isn’t known outside your household.

## 3. Static IP Address
- **Definition**: A Static IP address is an address that doesn’t change. It is manually assigned to a device and remains the same over time.
- **Example**: Think of it as a permanent home address that doesn’t change, making it easier for others to find you.

## 4. Dynamic IP Address
- **Definition**: A Dynamic IP address is temporarily assigned to a device each time it connects to the network. This address can change periodically as devices join and leave the network.
- **Example**: This is like a temporary address given to guests; they can stay for a while, but when they leave, someone else might take their place.
