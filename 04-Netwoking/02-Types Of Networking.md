Here are the common types of networking:

### Local Area Network (LAN)

- **Definition**: A network that connects devices in a small area, like a home or office.
- **Example**: In a home, all your devices (laptop, smartphone, printer) connected to the same Wi-Fi network are part of a LAN. It lets you share files and use the same printer from any device.

### Wide Area Network (WAN)

- **Definition**: A network that covers a large area, such as cities, countries, or even continents.
- **Example**: The internet is a WAN. It connects millions of LANs and other networks worldwide, allowing you to browse websites and send emails globally.

### Personal Area Network (PAN)

- **Definition**: A network that connects devices over a very short distance, usually within a few meters.
- **Example**: Using Bluetooth to connect your phone to your wireless earbuds or connecting your laptop to a printer via Bluetooth are examples of a PAN.

### Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

- **Definition**: A network that spans a city or large area, larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.
- **Example**: A city-wide Wi-Fi network that provides internet access to public areas like parks and cafes is a MAN.

### Virtual Private Network (VPN)

- **Definition**: A secure network created over a public network (like the internet) to keep data private.
- **Example**: When you use a VPN on your laptop to connect to your companyâ€™s network from home, it encrypts your data and hides your online activity from others.

These examples help illustrate how different types of networks are used in various situations to connect and share information.
