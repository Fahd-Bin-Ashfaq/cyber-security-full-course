# Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, networks, and data from being damaged or stolen and making sure no one unauthorized person gains data without permission. It involves using tools and methods to keep digital information safe from hackers and other threats.

# Types of Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity can be broadly categorized into two main approaches: **Offensive** and **Defensive**. Each approach has its own set of techniques and goals.

## Offensive Cybersecurity

Offensive cybersecurity involves proactively seeking out vulnerabilities and weaknesses in systems to identify and address potential threats before they can be exploited by malicious actors. This approach is often called "ethical hacking" or "penetration testing."

### Key Areas of Offensive Cybersecurity

1. **Penetration Testing (Ethical Hacking)**
   - **Description:** Simulates real-world attacks to find and fix system, network, and application vulnerabilities.
   - **Tools:** Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nmap.

2. **Red Teaming**
   - **Description:** Conducts simulated attacks to assess an organizationâ€™s overall security posture, including physical security and social engineering.
   - **Tools:** Cobalt Strike, Empire.

3. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - **Description:** Identifies and evaluates security weaknesses in systems and applications.
   - **Tools:** Nessus, OpenVAS.

4. **Social Engineering**
   - **Description:** Exploits human psychology to gain unauthorized access to information or systems.
   - **Tools:** Phishing simulations, pretexting.

## Defensive Cybersecurity

Defensive cybersecurity protects systems, networks, and data from attacks and unauthorized access. This approach involves implementing measures and strategies to detect, prevent, and respond to threats.

### Key Areas of Defensive Cybersecurity

1. **Network Security**
   - **Description:** Protects the integrity and usability of the network and data from unauthorized access and attacks.
   - **Tools:** Firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS).

2. **Endpoint Security**
   - **Description:** Secures individual devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets.
   - **Tools:** Antivirus software, endpoint detection and response (EDR).

3. **Application Security**
   - **Description:** Ensures that software applications are secure from vulnerabilities and threats.
   - **Tools:** Web application firewalls (WAF), static application security testing (SAST).

4. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
   - **Description:** Manages user identities and permissions to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to resources.
   - **Tools:** Multi-factor authentication (MFA), single sign-on (SSO).

5. **Incident Response**
   - **Description:** Responds to and manages security incidents to minimize damage and recover from attacks.
   - **Tools:** Incident response plans, forensics tools.

6. **Security Operations Center (SOC)**
   - **Description:** A centralized unit that handles the monitoring, detection, and response to security incidents and threats in real time. 
   - **Tools:** Splunk, LogRhythm.

Both offensive and defensive cybersecurity play crucial roles in a comprehensive security strategy. Offensive approaches help identify and mitigate potential threats proactively, while defensive measures protect against and respond to actual attacks.
