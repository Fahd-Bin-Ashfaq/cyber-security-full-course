# Cyber Threat vs. Cyber Attack
 
## Cyber Threat
- **Definition:** A cyber threat refers to any potential danger or malicious activity that can compromise the security of computer systems, networks, or digital assets of an Organization
- **Example:** A hacker who is actively looking for weaknesses in a network is considered a cyber threat, even if they haven't yet taken advantage of those weaknesses. 

## Cyber Attack
- **Definition:** A cyber attack is an intentional act to exploit or gain unauthorized access to a computer system, network, or data. This involves actual efforts to breach security measures and cause harm or theft.
- **Example:** A hacker breaks into a network and steals sensitive data, that action is classified as a cyber attack.


## Common Types of Cyber Attacks

1. **Phishing**
   - **Description:** An attempt to obtain sensitive information (like usernames, passwords, or credit card details) by masking as a trustworthy entity using electronic communications.
   - **Example:** An email that looks like itâ€™s from your bank, asking you to click a link and enter your account details.

2. **Malware**
   - **Description:** Malicious software designed to harm and exploit an individual or organization's computer system.
   - **Types:**
     - **Viruses:** Self-replicating code that attaches to other programs.
     - **Worms:** Self-replicating malware that spreads over networks.
     - **Trojans:** Malware that is masked as authorized software.
     - **Ransomware:** Encrypts files and demands payment for the decryption key.

3. **Denial of Service (DoS)**
   - **Description:** Overwhelming a system or network with fake traffic to make it unavailable to users.
   - **Example:** Flooding a website with excessive requests to crash it.

4. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**
   - **Description:** Intercepting and potentially altering communications between two parties without their knowledge.
   - **Example:** Eavesdropping on unencrypted Wi-Fi connections to capture sensitive data.

5. **SQL Injection**
   - **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in a web application's database query execution to execute malicious SQL code.
   - **Example:** Entering malicious SQL statements into a form field to gain unauthorized access to a database.

6. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - **Description:** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users to steal data or perform actions on their behalf.
   - **Example:** Inserting a script into a forum post that steals cookies from other users.

7. **Credential Stuffing**
   - **Description:** Using stolen username and password combinations to gain unauthorized access to accounts on various websites.
   - **Example:** Trying leaked login credentials from one site to access accounts on different sites.

8. **Insider Threat**
   - **Description:** Harm caused by individuals within an organization, such as employees or contractors, who misuse their access to systems and data.
   - **Example:** An employee intentionally leaking confidential information to a competitor.

9. **Zero-Day Exploit**
   - **Description:** Exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in software or hardware before the developer has released a fix.
   - **Example:** Attacking a newly discovered software flaw before a security patch is available.

These are just a few examples of cyber attacks, each with its own methods and impacts.
