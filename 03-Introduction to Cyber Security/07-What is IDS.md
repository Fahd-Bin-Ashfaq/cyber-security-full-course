**Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a tool that monitors a network or computer system for any signs of unauthorized access or suspicious activity. It works like a security alarm that alerts you if someone is trying to break into your system or if there's unusual behavior that might indicate a threat.

**Digital Signature**

A digital signature is like an electronic version of a handwritten signature or a stamped seal. It’s used to verify that a document or message is genuine and hasn’t been altered. It provides proof that the document came from the person who claims to have sent it and that it hasn’t been tampered with.

**Hashing**

Hashing is a process that takes an input (like a file or a message) and turns it into a fixed-size string of characters, which looks like a random jumble of letters and numbers. This string is called a hash. It’s used to check the integrity of data because even a tiny change in the input will produce a completely different hash.

**Footprinting**

Footprinting is the process of gathering information about a target system or network to find potential weaknesses. It’s like doing research on a target to understand its structure, its services, and its vulnerabilities before trying to exploit them. This information can help attackers plan their moves, but it’s also used by defenders to strengthen security.
