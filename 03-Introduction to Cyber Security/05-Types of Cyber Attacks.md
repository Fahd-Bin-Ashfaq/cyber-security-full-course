**Cyber Attacks** are intentional attempts by hackers or malicious actors to damage, steal, or gain unauthorized access to computers, networks, or data.

### Top 10 Types of Cyber Attacks:

1. **Phishing:** Using communication channels, such as emails, text messages, or phone calls, to trick people into giving away personal information like passwords or credit card details by pretending to be someone trustworthy, such as a bank, company, or government agency.

2. **Malware:** Harmful software that can damage your computer, steal data, or spy on you. Examples include viruses, worms, and ransomware.

3. **Ransomware:** A type of malware that locks you out of your computer or files until you pay a ransom.

4. **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack:** Overwhelming a website or service with too much traffic so it can't function properly.

5. **Man-in-the-Middle Attack (MitM):** Secretly intercepting and altering communication between two parties without them knowing.

6. **SQL Injection:** Inserting malicious code into a website's database to steal or manipulate data.

7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into a website that runs on a user's browser, potentially stealing information.

8. **Password Attack:** Trying to guess or crack a user's password to gain unauthorized access to a system.

9. **Zero-Day Attack:** Exploiting a security flaw in software that the developers don't know about yet, leaving no time to fix it.

These attacks aim to exploit vulnerabilities in systems to cause harm, steal information, or disrupt operations.
