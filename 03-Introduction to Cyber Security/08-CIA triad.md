The **CIA triad** is a fundamental model in cybersecurity that represents three core principles for securing information systems:

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is only accessible to those who are authorized to view it. This protects sensitive data from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

- **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy of information. This means ensuring that data is not altered or tampered with by unauthorized users and that it remains reliable and trustworthy.

- **Availability**: Ensuring that information and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed. This involves making sure systems and data are operational and can be accessed promptly by those who need them.
